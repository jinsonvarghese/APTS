# Evidence Package Manifest Example

Informative Appendix Example (non-normative)

This fictional example shows how the [Evidence Package Manifest](../Evidence_Package_Manifest.md) can be used to organize one verified finding, its supporting artifacts, and its handoff trail. It is not a required format and does not replace the manifest guidance, auditability requirements, or reporting requirements.

The sample uses fictional systems, identifiers, hashes, and file names. Replace them with operator-specific evidence references, retention rules, and customer-approved redaction decisions.

## Scenario

A customer authorized an autonomous web application test against a staging API. The platform reported a high-severity authorization bypass after confirming that the affected endpoint was in scope, reproducing the request sequence, and routing the finding through human review before report export.

| Field | Example Value |
|-------|---------------|
| **Engagement ID** | `eng-2026-042` |
| **Finding ID** | `APT-FIND-2026-042-003` |
| **Finding Title** | Example authorization bypass in staging API |
| **Customer Scope Reference** | `roe-2026-042-v3.yaml` |
| **Claimed Severity** | High |
| **Confidence** | 0.91 |
| **Report Export ID** | `report-export-2026-042-final` |

## Requirement Traceability

| Manifest Element | Example Evidence | Related Requirements |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Scope context and pre-action decision | `ev-001-scope-check.json` | APTS-SE-006, APTS-SE-015 |
| Raw request/response artifact with hash | `ev-002-request-response.har` | APTS-AR-010, APTS-RP-005 |
| Reproduction result | `ev-003-replay-result.json` | APTS-AR-016, APTS-AR-017, APTS-RP-004 |
| Human review record | `ev-004-human-review.md` | APTS-HO-010, APTS-RP-002 |
| Redaction log | `ev-005-redaction-log.json` | APTS-AR-015, APTS-RP-005 |
| Export hashes | `customer-report.pdf`, `ticket-export.json` | APTS-RP-015, APTS-TP-014 |

## Customer Review Walkthrough

A customer or reviewer can use the manifest to ask focused verification questions:

1. **Scope:** Does `ev-001` show that the target, time window, and action were in scope before the request was sent?
2. **Integrity:** Do artifact hashes match the files delivered in the evidence package?
3. **Provenance:** Can the operator trace discovery, reproduction, review, redaction, and export through audit log IDs?
4. **Reproducibility:** Does `ev-003` show a bounded replay that avoids unnecessary production impact?
5. **Human review:** Does `ev-004` identify the reviewer, decision, timestamp, and evidence considered?
6. **Redaction:** Does `ev-005` explain what was redacted and where raw restricted evidence is retained?
7. **Downstream handoff:** Can the final report and ticket export be tied back to the same finding and evidence package?

---

## Common Pitfalls This Example Avoids

- Reporting a finding without preserving the pre-action scope decision
- Mixing raw evidence, model summaries, and reviewer conclusions without provenance
- Redacting sensitive values without recording the redaction decision
- Exporting a ticket or report without a hash tying it back to the evidence package
- Treating human approval as a free-text comment instead of an auditable review event
